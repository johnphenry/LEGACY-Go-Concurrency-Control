# NOTICE: LEGACY PROJECT
This project is considered "legacy code". The code was written a long time ago and may be subject to code rot.
Disclaimer: The coding style used in this project most likely does not represent my current coding style or methodologies. A legacy repository is kept so long as it has stars/forks, so that other users can continue to view the code.
The original readme reads below:
# Go-Concurrency-Control
Controlling thousands of concurrent goroutines which will belong to game objects, rather than looping through objects and calling a non-concurrent update function. Allows for programming game objects each in its own thread, vastly simplifying the process of writing game code without requiring external scripting to do so.
